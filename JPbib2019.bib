MaNGA will investigate the internal kinematic structure and composition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearby galaxies. We summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and survey design in the context of MaNGA's key science goals and present prototype observations to demonstrate MaNGA's scientific potential. MaNGA employs dithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary in diameter from 12â€³ (19 fibers) to 32â€³ (127 fibers). Two dual-channel spectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 Ã… at R âˆ¼ 2000. With a typical integration time of 3 hr, MaNGA reaches a target r-band signal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (Ã…â€“1 per 2â€³ fiber) at 23 AB mag arcsecâ€“2, which is typical for the outskirts of MaNGA galaxies. Targets are selected with M

            â˜‰ using SDSS-I redshifts and i-band luminosity to achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, an approximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a wide range of environments. Analysis of our prototype observations demonstrates MaNGA's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formation and quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, and map the composition of stellar populations. MaNGA's spatially resolved spectra will enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies in the coming 6Â yr.}

  abstract={Weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure affects the determination of the cosmological deceleration parameter q 0 . We find that the lensing induced dispersions on truly standard candles are 0.04 and 0.02 mag at redshift z = 1 and z = 0.5, respectively, in a COBE -normalized cold dark matter universe with Ω 0 = 0.40, Λ 0 = 0.6, H = 65 km s -1 Mpc -1 , and σ 8 = 0.79. It is shown that one would observe q 0 = -0.395 −0.095 +0.125 and q 0 = -0.398 −0.077 +0.048 (the error bars are 2 σ limits) with standard candles with zero intrinsic dispersion at redshift z = 1 and z = 0.5, respectively, compared to the truth of q 0 = -0.400. A standard COBE normalized Ω 0 = 1 CDM model would produce three times as much variance and a mixed (hot and cold) dark matter model would lead to an intermediate result. One unique signature of this dispersion effect is its non-Gaussianity. Although the lensing induced dispersion at lower redshift is still significantly smaller than the currently best observed (total) dispersion of 0.12 mag in a sample of type Ia supernovae, selected with the multicolor light curve shape method, it becomes significant at higher redshift. We show that there is an optimal redshift, in the range z ~ 0.5-2.0 depending on the amplitude of the intrinsic dispersion of the standard candles, at which q 0 can be most accurately determined.}

There are good reasons to believe that perhaps most type Ia supernovae are the explosions of white dwarfs that have approached the Chandrasekhar mass, , and are disrupted by thermonuclear fusion of carbon and oxygen. However, the mechanism whereby such accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs explode continues to be uncertain. Recent progress in modeling type Ia supernovae as well as several of the still open questions are addressed in this review. Although the main emphasis is on studies of the explosion mechanism itself and on the related physical processes, including the physics of turbulent nuclear combustion in degenerate stars, we also discuss observational constraints. }

  abstract={We present an empirical method that uses multicolor light-curve shapes (MLCSs) to estimate the luminosity, distance, and total line-of-sight extinction of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The empirical correlation between the MLCSs and the luminosity is derived from a " training set" of nine SN Ia light curves with independent distance and reddening estimates. We find that intrinsically dim SN Ia's are redder and have faster light curves than the bright ones, which are slow and blue. By 35 days after maximum, the intrinsic color variations become negligible. A formal treatment of extinction employing Bayes's theorem is used to estimate the best value and its uncertainty. Applying the MLCS method to both light curves and to color curves provides enough information to determine which supernovae are dim because they are distant, which are intrinsically dim, and which are dim because of extinction by dust. The precision of the MLCS distances is examined by constructing a Hubble diagram with an independent set of 20 SN Ia's. The dispersion of 0.12 mag indicates a typical distance accuracy of 5% for a single object, and the intercept yields a Hubble constant on the Sandage et al. Cepheid distance scale of H 0 = 64 ± 3 (statistical) km s –1 Mpc –1 (±6 total error). The slope of 0.2010 ± 0.0035 mag over the distance interval 32.2 < μ < 38.3 yields the most precise confirmation of the linearity of the Hubble law.}

	abstract = {General relativity indicates that any sufficiently massive object bends the path of light passing by it. This effect is known as gravitational lensing. Goobar et al. have identified a supernova that is strongly lensed by a foreground galaxy, causing it to be highly magnified and splitting the light into four separate images. What is more, it is a type Ia supernova, a well-studied variety with reliable properties that can be used to constrain models of the lensing. This distinctive object will enable cosmological measurements and can be used to probe the distribution of mass in the foreground galaxy.Science, this issue p. 291We report the discovery of a multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova, iPTF16geu (SN 2016geu), at redshift z = 0.409. This phenomenon was identified because the light from the stellar explosion was magnified more than 50 times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening galaxy. We used high-spatial-resolution observations to resolve four images of the lensed supernova, approximately 0.3 arc seconds from the center of the foreground galaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of ~1 kiloparsec, smaller than is typical in other studies of extragalactic gravitational lensing. The large magnification and symmetric image configuration imply close alignment between the lines of sight to the supernova and to the lens. The relative magnifications of the four images provide evidence for substructures in the lensing galaxy.},

  abstract={The High-Z Supernova Search is an international collaboration to discover and monitor Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at z > 0.2 with the aim of measuring cosmic deceleration and global curvature. Our collaboration has pursued a basic understanding of supernovae in the nearby universe, discovering and observing a large sample of objects and developing methods to measure accurate distances with SNe Ia. This paper describes the extension of this program to z ≥ 0.2, outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. We have devised high-throughput filters that provide accurate two-color rest frame B and V light curves of SNe Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected luminosity distances in the range 0.25 < z < 0.55. Sources of systematic error from K -corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are investigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral observations of SN 1995K, our program's first supernova (SN), and use the data to obtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the z = 0.479 host galaxy. This object, when combined with a nearby sample of SNe, yields an estimate for the matter density of the universe of Ω M =-0.2 −0.8 +1.0 if Ω Λ = 0. For a spatially flat universe composed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find Ω M =0.4 −0.4 +0.5 , Ω ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/507/1/46/img4.gif] {_{{\Lambda}}} =0.6 −0.5 +0.4 . We demonstrate that with a sample of ~30 objects, we should be able to determine relative luminosity distances over the range 0 < z < 0.5 with sufficient precision to measure Ω M with an uncertainty of ±0.2.}

  abstract={Weak gravitational lensing is normally assumed to have only two principle effects: a magnification of a source and a distortion of the sources shape in the form of a shear. However, further distortions are actually present owing to changes in the gravitational field across the scale of the ray bundle of light propagating to us, resulting in the familiar arcs in lensed images. This is normally called the flexion, and is approximated by Taylor expanding the shear and magnification across the image plane. However, the physical origin of this effect arises from higher-order corrections in the geodesic deviation equation governing the gravitational force between neighbouring geodesics— so involves derivatives of the Riemann tensor. We show that integrating the second-order geodesic deviation equation results in a `Hessian map' for gravitational lensing, which is a higher-order addition to the Jacobi map. We derive the general form of the Hessian map in an arbitrary spacetime paying particular attention to the separate effects of local Ricci versus non-local Weyl curvature. We then specialise to the case of a perturbed FLRW model, and give the general form of the Hessian for the first time. This has a host of new contributions which could in principle be used as tests for modified gravity.}

JWST’s unique combination of high sensitivity and broad wavelength coverage will enable the accurate measurement of transits with high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Most importantly, JWST spectroscopy will investigate planetary atmospheres to determine atomic and molecular compositions, to probe vertical and horizontal structure, and to follow dynamical evolution, i.e., exoplanet weather. JWST will sample a diverse population of planets of varying masses and densities in a wide variety of environments characterized by a range of host star masses and metallicities, orbital semi-major axes, and eccentricities. A broad program of exoplanet science could use a substantial fraction of the overall JWST mission.},

Jester et al. (2005)

The following transformation equations were extracted from Table 1 of Jester et al. (2005) and are generally useful for stars and for quasars. The transformation equations for z <= 2.1 quasars is based upon synthetic photometry of an updated version of the quasar composite spectrum of Vanden Berk et al. (2001) using DR1 data as well as the red and reddened quasar composites for Richards et al. (2003). The transformations for stars were derived from the Smith et al. (2002) u'g'r'i'z' photometry of Landolt stars, suitably transformed from the USNO-1.0m u'g'r'i'z' system to the SDSS 2.5m ugriz system via the u'g'r'i'z'-to-ugriz transformations.

The transformation equations for stars supercede those of Fukugita et al. (1996) and Smith et al. (2002).

  abstract={We analyze the bivariate distribution, in color versus absolute magnitude ( u-r vs. M r ), of a low-redshift sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (2400 deg 2 , 0.004 < z < 0.08, -23.5 < M r < -15.5). We trace the bimodality of the distribution from luminous to faint galaxies by fitting double Gaussians to the color functions separated in absolute magnitude bins. Color-magnitude (CM) relations are obtained for red and blue distributions (early- and late-type, predominantly field, galaxies) without using any cut in morphology. Instead, the analysis is based on the assumption of normal Gaussian distributions in color. We find that the CM relations are well fitted by a straight line plus a tanh function. Both relations can be described by a shallow CM trend (slopes of about -0.04, -0.05) plus a steeper transition in the average galaxy properties over about 2 mag. The midpoints of the transitions ( M r = -19.8 and -20.8 for the red and blue distributions, respectively) occur around 2 × 10 10 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/calM.gif] {Script M} ☉ after converting luminosities to stellar mass. Separate luminosity functions are obtained for the two distributions. The red distribution has a more luminous characteristic magnitude and a shallower faint-end slope ( M * = -21.5, α = -0.8) compared to the blue distribution (α ≈ -1.3, depending on the parameterization). These are approximately converted to galaxy stellar mass functions. The red distribution galaxies have a higher number density per magnitude for masses greater than about 3 × 10 10 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/calM.gif] {Script M} ☉ . Using a simple merger model, we show that the differences between the two functions are consistent with the red distribution being formed from major galaxy mergers.}

  abstract={Detecting the atmospheres of low-mass, low-temperature exoplanets is a high-priority goal on the path to ultimately detecting biosignatures in the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets. High-precision HST observations of several super-Earths with equilibrium temperatures below 1000 K have to date all resulted in featureless transmission spectra, which have been suggested to be due to high-altitude clouds. We report the detection of an atmospheric feature in the atmosphere of a 1.6 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/153/4/191/ajaa6477ieqn1.gif] {${M}_{\oplus }$} transiting exoplanet, GJ 1132 b, with an equilibrium temperature of ∼600 K and orbiting a nearby M dwarf. We present observations of nine transits of the planet obtained simultaneously in the griz and JHK passbands. We find an average radius of 1.43 ± 0.16 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/153/4/191/ajaa6477ieqn2.gif] {${R}_{\oplus }$} for the planet, averaged over all the passbands, and a radius of 0.255 ± 0.023 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/153/4/191/ajaa6477ieqn3.gif] {${R}_{\odot }$} for the star, both of which are significantly greater than previously found. The planet radius can be decomposed into a “surface radius” at ∼1.375 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/153/4/191/ajaa6477ieqn4.gif] {${R}_{\oplus }$} overlaid by atmospheric features that increase the observed radius in the z and K bands. The z -band radius is 4 σ higher than the continuum, suggesting a strong detection of an atmosphere. We deploy a suite of tests to verify the reliability of the transmission spectrum, which are greatly helped by the existence of repeat observations. The large z -band transit depth indicates strong opacity from H 2 O and/or CH 4 or a hitherto-unconsidered opacity. A surface radius of 1.375 ± 0.16 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/153/4/191/ajaa6477ieqn5.gif] {${R}_{\oplus }$} allows for a wide range of interior compositions ranging from a nearly Earth-like rocky interior, with ∼70% silicate and ∼30% Fe, to a substantially H 2 O-rich water world.}

Planet b transits the host star with a period Pb = 33.6 days and exhibits large transit timing variations indicative of a perturber. Dynamical modeling uniquely detects an outer nontransiting planet c near the 5:3 resonance (Pc = 57.0 days) with a mass 0.37 times that of Jupiter. Transits of a third planetary candidate are also found: a 1.7{\textendash}Earth radius super-Earth with a 6.8-day period. Our analysis indicates a system with nearly coplanar and circular orbits, reminiscent of the orderly arrangement within the solar system.},

The bulkof the organic carbon consistsof an insoluble macromolecular material with a complexstructure.

	abstract = {The importance of comets for the origin of life on Earth has been advocated for many decades. Amino acids are key ingredients in chemistry, leading to life as we know it. Many primitive meteorites contain amino acids, and it is generally believed that these are formed by aqueous alterations. In the collector aerogel and foil samples of the Stardust mission after the flyby at comet Wild 2, the simplest form of amino acids, glycine, has been found together with precursor molecules methylamine and ethylamine. Because of contamination issues of the samples, a cometary origin was deduced from the 13C isotopic signature. We report the presence of volatile glycine accompanied by methylamine and ethylamine in the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko measured by the ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis) mass spectrometer, confirming the Stardust results. Together with the detection of phosphorus and a multitude of organic molecules, this result demonstrates that comets could have played a crucial role in the emergence of life on Earth.},

  abstract={Identifying terrestrial planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of other stars is one of the primary goals of ongoing radial velocity (RV) and transit exoplanet surveys and proposed future space missions. Most current estimates of the boundaries of the HZ are based on one-dimensional (1D), cloud-free, climate model calculations by Kasting et al. However, this model used band models that were based on older HITRAN and HITEMP line-by-line databases. The inner edge of the HZ in the Kasting et al. model was determined by loss of water, and the outer edge was determined by the maximum greenhouse provided by a CO 2 atmosphere. A conservative estimate for the width of the HZ from this model in our solar system is 0.95-1.67 AU. Here an updated 1D radiative-convective, cloud-free climate model is used to obtain new estimates for HZ widths around F, G, K, and M stars. New H 2 O and CO 2 absorption coefficients, derived from the HITRAN 2008 and HITEMP 2010 line-by-line databases, are important improvements to the climate model. According to the new model, the water-loss (inner HZ) and maximum greenhouse (outer HZ) limits for our solar system are at 0.99 and 1.70 AU, respectively, suggesting that the present Earth lies near the inner edge. Additional calculations are performed for stars with effective temperatures between 2600 and 7200 K, and the results are presented in parametric form, making them easy to apply to actual stars. The new model indicates that, near the inner edge of the HZ, there is no clear distinction between runaway greenhouse and water-loss limits for stars with T eff ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 5000 K, which has implications for ongoing planet searches around K and M stars. To assess the potential habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets, we propose using stellar flux incident on a planet rather than equilibrium temperature. This removes the dependence on planetary (Bond) albedo, which varies depending on the host star's spectral type. We suggest that conservative estimates of the HZ (water-loss and maximum greenhouse limits) should be used for current RV surveys and Kepler mission to obtain a lower limit on η ⊕ , so that future flagship missions like TPF-C and Darwin are not undersized. Our model does not include the radiative effects of clouds; thus, the actual HZ boundaries may extend further in both directions than the estimates just given.}

  abstract={We re-analyze 4 years of HARPS spectra of the nearby M1.5 dwarf GJ 667C available through the European Southern Observatory public archive. The new radial velocity (RV) measurements were obtained using a new data analysis technique that derives the Doppler measurement and other instrumental effects using a least-squares approach. Combining these new 143 measurements with 41 additional RVs from the Magellan/Planet Finder Spectrograph and Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer spectrometers reveals three additional signals beyond the previously reported 7.2 day candidate, with periods of 28 days, 75 days, and a secular trend consistent with the presence of a gas giant (period ~10 years). The 28 day signal implies a planet candidate with a minimum mass of 4.5 M ⊕ orbiting well within the canonical definition of the star's liquid water habitable zone (HZ), that is, the region around the star at which an Earth-like planet could sustain liquid water on its surface. Still, the ultimate water supporting capability of this candidate depends on properties that are unknown such as its albedo, atmospheric composition, and interior dynamics. The 75 day signal is less certain, being significantly affected by aliasing interactions among a potential 91 day signal, and the likely rotation period of the star at 105 days detected in two activity indices. GJ 667C is the common proper motion companion to the GJ 667AB binary, which is metal-poor compared to the Sun. The presence of a super-Earth in the HZ of a metal-poor M dwarf in a triple star system supports the evidence that such worlds should be ubiquitous in the Galaxy.}

  abstract={We have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function of ultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. The sample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample matched with detections in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) bands in the Medium Imaging Survey being carried out by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ) satellite. In the (NUV − r ) 0.1 versus M r ,0.1 galaxy color-magnitude diagram, the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. The (NUV − r ) 0.1 color distribution at each M r ,0.1 is not well fit by the sum of two Gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. The peaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity, with a distinct blue peak visible up to M r ,0.1 ~ − 23. The r 0.1 -band luminosity functions vary systematically with color, with the faint-end slope and characteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. After correcting for attenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one-quarter of the color variation along the blue sequence is due to dust, with the remainder due to star formation history and metallicity. Finally, we present the distribution of galaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. The specific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequence progress from low-mass galaxies with star formation rates that increase somewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant star formation rate. Above a stellar mass of ~10 10.5 M ☉ , galaxies with low ratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.}

abstract ={The first terrestrialization of species that evolved from previously aquatic taxa was a seminal event in evolutionary history. For vertebrates, one of the most important terrestrialized groups, this event was interrupted by a time interval known as Romer's Gap, for which, until recently, few fossils were known. Here, we argue that geochronologic range data of terrestrial arthropods show a pattern similar to that of vertebrates. Thus, Romer's Gap is real, occupied an interval from 360 million years before present (MYBP) to 345 MYBP, and occurred when environmental conditions were unfavorable for air-breathing, terrestrial animals. These model results suggest that atmospheric oxygen levels were the major driver of successful terrestrialization, and a low-oxygen interval accounts for Romer's Gap. Results also show that terrestrialization among members of arthropod and vertebrate clades occurred in two distinct phases. The first phase was a 65-million-year (My) interval from 425 to 360 MYBP, representing an earlier, prolonged event of complete arthropod terrestrialization of smaller-sized forms (425�385 MYBP) and a subsequent, modest, and briefer event of incipient terrestrialization of larger-sized, aquatic vertebrates (385�360 MYBP). The second phase began at 345 MYBP, characterized by numerous new terrestrial species emerging in both major clades. The first and second terrestrialization phases bracket Romer's Gap, which represents a depauperate spectrum of major arthropod and vertebrate taxa before a major Late Paleozoic colonization of terrestrial habitats.},

De Sanctis et al. examined infrared spectra taken by the Dawn spacecraft as it orbited Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt (see the Perspective by K{\"u}ppers). In some small patches on the surface, they detected absorption bands characteristic of aliphatic organic compounds. The authors ruled out an external origin, such as an impact, suggesting that the material must have formed on Ceres. Together with other compounds detected previously, this supports the existence of a complex prebiotic chemistry at some point in Ceres{\textquoteright} history.Science, this issue p. 719; see also p. 692Organic compounds occur in some chondritic meteorites, and their signatures on solar system bodies have been sought for decades. Spectral signatures of organics have not been unambiguously identified on the surfaces of asteroids, whereas they have been detected on cometary nuclei. Data returned by the Visible and InfraRed Mapping Spectrometer on board the Dawn spacecraft show a clear detection of an organic absorption feature at 3.4 micrometers on dwarf planet Ceres. This signature is characteristic of aliphatic organic matter and is mainly localized on a broad region of ~1000 square kilometers close to the ~50-kilometer Ernutet crater. The combined presence on Ceres of ammonia-bearing hydrated minerals, water ice, carbonates, salts, and organic material indicates a very complex chemical environment, suggesting favorable environments to prebiotic chemistry.},

We analyzed archival survey data and found a 30-jansky dispersed burst, less than 5 milliseconds in duration, located 3{\textdegree} from the Small Magellanic Cloud. The burst properties argue against a physical association with our Galaxy or the Small Magellanic Cloud. Current models for the free electron content in the universe imply that the burst is less than 1 gigaparsec distant. No further bursts were seen in 90 hours of additional observations, which implies that it was a singular event such as a supernova or coalescence of relativistic objects. Hundreds of similar events could occur every day and, if detected, could serve as cosmological probes.},

  abstract={The two independent `plus' and `cross' polarization waveforms associated with the gravitational waves emitted by inspiralling, non-spinning, compact binaries are presented, ready for use in the data analysis of signals received by future laser interferometer gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO. The computation is based on a recently derived expression of the gravitational field at the second-post-Newtonian approximation of general relativity beyond the dominant (Newtonian) quadrupolar field. The use of these theoretical waveforms to make measurements of astrophysical parameters and to test the nature of relativistic gravity is discussed.}

  abstract={The upcoming European design study 'Einstein gravitational-wave Telescope' represents the first step towards a substantial, international effort for the design of a third-generation interferometric gravitational wave detector. It is generally believed that third-generation instruments might not be installed into existing infrastructures but will provoke a new search for optimal detector sites. Consequently, the detector design could be subject to fewer constraints than the on-going design of the second-generation instruments. In particular, it will be prudent to investigate alternatives to the traditional L-shaped Michelson interferometer. In this paper, we review an old proposal to use three Michelson interferometers in a triangular configuration. We use this example of a triple Michelson interferometer to clarify the terminology and will put this idea into the context of more recent research on interferometer technologies. Furthermore, the benefits of a triangular detector will be used to motivate this design as a good starting point for a more detailed research effort towards a third-generation gravitational-wave detector.}

abstract="The Amaldi 10 Parallel Session C2 on gravitational wave (GW) search results, data analysis and parameter estimation included three lively sessions of lectures by 13 presenters, and 34 posters. The talks and posters covered a huge range of material, including results and analysis techniques for ground-based GW detectors, targeting anticipated signals from different astrophysical sources: compact binary inspiral, merger and ringdown; GW bursts from intermediate mass binary black hole mergers, cosmic string cusps, core-collapse supernovae, and other unmodeled sources; continuous waves from spinning neutron stars; and a stochastic GW background. There was considerable emphasis on Bayesian techniques for estimating the parameters of coalescing compact binary systems from the gravitational waveforms extracted from the data from the advanced detector network. This included methods to distinguish deviations of the signals from what is expected in the context of General Relativity.",

abstract="The Einstein Telescope is a proposed third generation gravitational wave detector that will operate in the region of 1�Hz to a few kHz. As well as the inspiral of compact binaries composed of neutron stars or black holes, the lower frequency cut-off of the detector will open the window to a number of new sources. These will include the end stage of inspirals, plus merger and ringdown of intermediate mass black holes, where the masses of the component bodies are on the order of a few hundred solar masses. There is also the possibility of observing intermediate mass ratio inspirals, where a stellar mass compact object inspirals into a black hole which is a few hundred to a few thousand times more massive. In this article, we investigate some of the data analysis challenges for the Einstein Telescope such as the effects of increased source number, the need for more accurate waveform models and the some of the computational issues that a data analysis strategy might face.",

At temperatures above 1 K, when the material is in the normal-conducting state, the measured signals are in good agreement with the expected values based on the cosmic rays data and on the thermo-acoustic model. When \{NAUTILUS\} was operated at the temperature of 0.14 K, in superconductive state, large signals produced by cosmic ray interactions, more energetic than expected, were recorded. The \{NAUTILUS\} data in this case are in agreement with the measurements done by a dedicated experiment on a particle beam. The biggest recorded event was in \{EXPLORER\} and excited the first longitudinal mode to a vibrational energy of ∼670 K, corresponding to ∼360 TeV absorbed in the bar. Cosmic rays can be an important background in future acoustic detectors of improved sensitivity. At present, they represent a useful tool to verify the gravitational wave antenna performance. "

  abstract={The first simultaneous operation of the AURIGA detector and the LIGO observatory was an opportunity to explore real data, joint analysis methods between two very different types of gravitational wave detectors: resonant bars and interferometers. This paper describes a coincident gravitational wave burst search, where data from the LIGO interferometers are cross-correlated at the time of AURIGA candidate events to identify coincident transients. The analysis pipeline is tuned with two thresholds, on the signal-to-noise ratio of AURIGA candidate events and on the significance of the cross-correlation test in LIGO. The false alarm rate is estimated by introducing time shifts between data sets and the network detection efficiency is measured by adding simulated gravitational wave signals to the detector output. The simulated waveforms have a significant fraction of power in the narrower AURIGA band. In the absence of a detection, we discuss how to set an upper limit on the rate of gravitational waves and to interpret it according to different source models. Due to the short amount of analyzed data and to the high rate of non-Gaussian transients in the detectors' noise at the time, the relevance of this study is methodological: this was the first joint search for gravitational wave bursts among detectors with such different spectral sensitivity and the first opportunity for the resonant and interferometric communities to unify languages and techniques in the pursuit of their common goal.}

  abstract={A search for cosmic neutrino sources using six years of data collected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope has been performed. Clusters of muon neutrinos over the expected atmospheric background have been looked for. No clear signal has been found. The most signal-like accumulation of events is located at equatorial coordinates R.A. = –46.°8 and decl. = –64.°9 and corresponds to a 2.2σ background fluctuation. In addition, upper limits on the flux normalization of an E –2 muon neutrino energy spectrum have been set for 50 pre-selected astrophysical objects. Finally, motivated by an accumulation of seven events relatively close to the Galactic Center in the recently reported neutrino sample of the IceCube telescope, a search for point sources in a broad region around this accumulation has been carried out. No indication of a neutrino signal has been found in the ANTARES data and upper limits on the flux normalization of an E –2 energy spectrum of neutrinos from point sources in that region have been set. The 90% confidence level upper limits on the muon neutrino flux normalization vary between 3.5 and 5.1 × 10 –8 GeV cm –2 s –1 , depending on the exact location of the source.}

  abstract={Using a two-dimensional hydrodynamics code (PROMETHEUS), we explore the continued evolution of rotating helium stars, M α ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 10 M ☉ , in which iron-core collapse does not produce a successful outgoing shock but instead forms a black hole of 2-3 M ☉ . The model explored in greatest detail is the 14 M ☉ helium core of a 35 M ☉ main-sequence star. The outcome is sensitive to the angular momentum. For j 16 ≡ j /(10 16 cm 2 s -1 ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 3, material falls into the black hole almost uninhibited. No outflows are expected. For j 16 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 20, the infalling matter is halted by centrifugal force outside 1000 km where neutrino losses are negligible. The equatorial accretion rate is very low, and explosive oxygen burning may power a weak equatorial explosion. For 3 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} j 16 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 20, however, a reasonable value for such stars, a compact disk forms at a radius at which the gravitational binding energy can be efficiently radiated as neutrinos or converted to beamed outflow by magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) processes. These are the best candidates for producing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Here we study the formation of such a disk, the associated flow patterns, and the accretion rate for disk viscosity parameter α ≈ 0.001 and 0.1. Infall along the rotational axis is initially uninhibited, and an evacuated channel opens during the first few seconds. Meanwhile the black hole is spun up by the accretion (to a ≈ 0.9), and energy is dissipated in the disk by MHD processes and radiated by neutrinos. For the α = 0.1 model, appreciable energetic outflows develop between polar angles of 30° and 45°. These outflows, powered by viscous dissipation in the disk, have an energy of up to a few times 10 51 ergs and a mass ~1 M ☉ and are rich in 56 Ni. They constitute a supernova-like explosion by themselves. Meanwhile accretion through the disk is maintained for approximately 10-20 s but is time variable (±30%) because of hydrodynamical instabilities at the outer edge in a region where nuclei are experiencing photodisintegration. Because the efficiency of neutrino energy deposition is sensitive to the accretion rate, this instability leads to highly variable energy deposition in the polar regions. Some of this variability, which has significant power at 50 ms and overtones, may persist in the time structure of the burst. During the time followed, the average accretion rate for the standard α = 0.1 and j 16 = 10 model is 0.07 M ☉ s -1 . The total energy deposited along the rotational axes by neutrino annihilation is (1-14) × 10 51 ergs, depending upon the evolution of the Kerr parameter and uncertain neutrino efficiencies. Simulated deposition of energy in the polar regions, at a constant rate of 5 × 10 50 ergs s -1 per pole, results in strong relativistic outflow jets beamed to about 1% of the sky. These jets may be additionally modulated by instabilities in the sides of the "nozzle" through which they flow. The jets blow aside the accreting material, remain highly focused, and are capable of penetrating the star in ~10 s. After the jet breaks through the surface of the star, highly relativistic flow can emerge. Because of the sensitivity of the mass ejection and jets to accretion rate, angular momentum, and disk viscosity, and the variation of observational consequences with viewing angle, a large range of outcomes is possible, ranging from bright GRBs like GRB 971214 to faint GRB-supernovae like SN 1998bw. X-ray precursors are also possible as the jet first breaks out of the star. While only a small fraction of supernovae make GRBs, we predict that collapsars will always make supernovae similar to SN 1998bw. However, hard, energetic GRBs shorter than a few seconds will be difficult to produce in this model and may require merging neutron stars and black holes for their explanation.}

  abstract={We present a comprehensive description of the population synthesis code StarTrack. The original code has been significantly modified and updated. Special emphasis is placed here on processes leading to the formation and further evolution of compact objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes). Both single and binary star populations are considered. The code now incorporates detailed calculations of all mass transfer phases, a full implementation of orbital evolution due to tides, as well as the most recent estimates of magnetic braking. This updated version of StarTrack can be used for a wide variety of problems, with relevance to observations with many current and planned observatories, e.g., studies of X-ray binaries ( Chandra , XMM-Newton ), gravitational radiation sources (LIGO, LISA ), and gamma-ray burst progenitors ( HETE-II , Swift ). The code has already been used in studies of Galactic and extragalactic X-ray binary populations, black holes in young star clusters, Type Ia supernova progenitors, and double compact object populations. Here we describe in detail the input physics, we present the code calibration and tests, and we outline our current studies in the context of X-ray binary populations.}

  abstract={We compare evolutionary predictions of double compact object merger rate densities with initial and forthcoming LIGO/Virgo upper limits. We find that: (i) Due to the cosmological reach of advanced detectors, current conversion methods of population synthesis predictions into merger rate densities are insufficient. (ii) Our optimistic models are a factor of 18 below the initial LIGO/Virgo upper limits for BH–BH systems, indicating that a modest increase in observational sensitivity (by a factor of ∼2.5) may bring the first detections or first gravitational wave constraints on binary evolution. (iii) Stellar-origin massive BH–BH mergers should dominate event rates in advanced LIGO/Virgo and can be detected out to redshift z ≃ 2 with templates including inspiral, merger, and ringdown. Normal stars ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/819/2/108/apj522690ieqn1.gif] {$\lt 150\;{M}_{\odot }$} ) can produce such mergers with total redshifted mass up to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/819/2/108/apj522690ieqn2.gif] {${M}_{{\rm{tot,z}}}\simeq 400\;{M}_{\odot }$} . (iv) High black hole (BH) natal kicks can severely limit the formation of massive BH–BH systems (both in isolated binary and in dynamical dense cluster evolution), and thus would eliminate detection of these systems even at full advanced LIGO/Virgo sensitivity. We find that low and high BH natal kicks are allowed by current observational electromagnetic constraints. (v) The majority of our models yield detections of all types of mergers (NS–NS, BH–NS, BH–BH) with advanced detectors. Numerous massive BH–BH merger detections will indicate small (if any) natal kicks for massive BHs.}

  abstract={The discovery of the gravitational-wave (GW) source GW150914 with the Advanced LIGO detectors provides the first observational evidence for the existence of binary black hole (BH) systems that inspiral and merge within the age of the universe. Such BH mergers have been predicted in two main types of formation models, involving isolated binaries in galactic fields or dynamical interactions in young and old dense stellar environments. The measured masses robustly demonstrate that relatively ?heavy? BHs ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/818/2/L22/apjl522793ieqn1.gif] {$\gtrsim 25$} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/818/2/L22/apjl522793ieqn2.gif] {${M}_{\odot }$} ) can form in nature. This discovery implies relatively weak massive-star winds and thus the formation of GW150914 in an environment with a metallicity lower than about 1/2 of the solar value. The rate of binary-BH (BBH) mergers inferred from the observation of GW150914 is consistent with the higher end of rate predictions ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/818/2/L22/apjl522793ieqn3.gif] {$\gtrsim 1$} Gpc ?3 yr ?1 ) from both types of formation models. The low measured redshift ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/818/2/L22/apjl522793ieqn4.gif] {$z\simeq 0.1$} ) of GW150914 and the low inferred metallicity of the stellar progenitor imply either BBH formation in a low-mass galaxy in the local universe and a prompt merger, or formation at high redshift with a time delay between formation and merger of several Gyr. This discovery motivates further studies of binary-BH formation astrophysics. It also has implications for future detections and studies by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, and GW detectors in space.}

  abstract={Understanding the formation of the first stars is one of the frontier topics in modern astrophysics and cosmology. Their emergence signalled the end of the cosmic dark ages, a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, leading to a fundamental transformation of the early Universe through the production of ionizing photons and the initial enrichment with heavy chemical elements. We here review the state of our knowledge, separating the well understood elements of our emerging picture from those where more work is required. Primordial star formation is unique in that its initial conditions can be directly inferred from the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model of cosmological structure formation. Combined with gas cooling that is mediated via molecular hydrogen, one can robustly identify the regions of primordial star formation, the so-called minihalos, having total masses of ∼10 6 M ⊙ and collapsing at redshifts z ≃ 20–30. Within this framework, a number of studies have defined a preliminary standard model, with the main result that the first stars were predominantly massive. This model has recently been modified to include a ubiquitous mode of fragmentation in the protostellar disks, such that the typical outcome of primordial star formation may be the formation of a binary or small multiple stellar system. We will also discuss extensions to this standard picture due to the presence of dynamically significant magnetic fields, of heating from self-annihalating WIMP dark matter, or cosmic rays. We conclude by discussing possible strategies to empirically test our theoretical models. Foremost among them are predictions for the upcoming James Webb space telescope (JWST), to be launched ∼2018, and for ‘stellar archaeology’, which probes the abundance pattern in the oldest, most-metal poor stars in our cosmic neighborhood, thereby constraining the nucleosynthesis inside the first supernovae.}

Mass loss is an important aspect for the evolution of massive stars, the rotational properties of the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts, and is essential in assessing whether the most massive stars explode as pair-instability supernovae, or avoid them due to mass loss. As a result, the rate of mass loss is critical for our understanding of the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium. Of topical interest is the question whether luminous blue variables are the progenitors of supernovae. Although there is a growing body of evidence to suggest this, it remains as yet unexplained by modern stellar evolution models."

  abstract={We present the spectrum of compact object masses: neutron stars and black holes (BHs) that originate from single stars in different environments. In particular, we calculate the dependence of maximum BH mass on metallicity and on some specific wind mass loss rates (e.g., Hurley et al. and Vink et al.). Our calculations show that the highest mass BHs observed in the Galaxy M bh ~ 15 M ☉ in the high metallicity environment ( Z = Z ☉ = 0.02) can be explained with stellar models and the wind mass loss rates adopted here. To reach this result we had to set luminous blue variable mass loss rates at the level of ~10 –4 M ☉ yr –1 and to employ metallicity-dependent Wolf-Rayet winds. With such winds, calibrated on Galactic BH mass measurements, the maximum BH mass obtained for moderate metallicity ( Z = 0.3 Z ☉ = 0.006) is M bh,max = 30 M ☉ . This is a rather striking finding as the mass of the most massive known stellar BH is M bh = 23-34 M ☉ and, in fact, it is located in a small star-forming galaxy with moderate metallicity. We find that in the very low (globular cluster-like) metallicity environment the maximum BH mass can be as high as M bh,max = 80 M ☉ ( Z = 0.01 Z ☉ = 0.0002). It is interesting to note that X-ray luminosity from Eddington-limited accretion onto an 80 M ☉ BH is of the order of ~10 40 erg s –1 and is comparable to luminosities of some known ultra-luminous X-ray sources. We emphasize that our results were obtained for single stars only and that binary interactions may alter these maximum BH masses (e.g., accretion from a close companion). This is strictly a proof-of-principle study which demonstrates that stellar models can naturally explain even the most massive known stellar BHs.}

abstract ={The old open cluster M67 is an ideal testbed for current cluster evolution models because of its dynamically evolved structure and rich stellar populations that show clear signs of interaction between stellar, binary and cluster evolution. Here, we present the first truly direct N-body model for M67, evolved from zero age to 4 Gyr taking full account of cluster dynamics as well as stellar and binary evolution. Our preferred model starts with 36 000 stars (12 000 single stars and 12 000 binaries) and a total mass of nearly 19 000 M?, placed in a Galactic tidal field at 8.0 kpc from the Galactic Centre. Our choices for the initial conditions and for the primordial binary population are explained in detail. At 4 Gyr, the age of M67, the total mass has reduced to 2000 M? as a result of mass loss and stellar escapes. The mass and half-mass radius of luminous stars in the cluster are a good match to observations, although the model is more centrally concentrated than observations indicate. The stellar mass and luminosity functions (LFs) are significantly flattened by preferential escape of low-mass stars. We find that M67 is dynamically old enough that information about the initial mass function (IMF) is lost, both from the current LF and from the current mass fraction in white dwarfs (WDs).The model contains 20 blue stragglers (BSs) at 4 Gyr, which is slightly less than the 28 observed in M67. Nine are in binaries. The blue stragglers were formed by a variety of means and we find formation paths for the whole variety observed in M67. Both the primordial binary population and the dynamical cluster environment play an essential role in shaping the population. A substantial population of short-period primordial binaries (with periods less than a few days) is needed to explain the observed number of BSs in M67. The evolution and properties of two-thirds of the BSs, including all found in binaries, have been altered by cluster dynamics and nearly half would not have formed at all outside the cluster environment. On the other hand, the cluster environment is also instrumental in destroying potential BSs from the primordial binary population, so that the total number is in fact slightly smaller than what would be expected from evolving the same binary stars in isolation.},

abstract ={We present and analyse a catalogue of 233 pulsars with proper motion measurements. The sample contains a wide variety of pulsars including recycled objects and those associated with globular clusters or supernova remnants. After taking the most precise proper motions for those pulsars for which multiple measurements are available, the majority of the proper motions (58 per cent) are derived from pulsar timing methods, 41 per cent using interferometers and the remaining 1 per cent using optical telescopes. Many of the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) speeds (referring to speeds measured in one coordinate only and the magnitudes of the transverse velocities, respectively) derived from these measurements are somewhat lower than earlier estimates because of the use of the most recent electron density model in determining pulsar distances. The mean 1D speeds for the normal and recycled pulsars are 152(10) and 54(6) km s?1, respectively. The corresponding mean 2D speeds are 246(22) and 87(13) km s?1. PSRs B2011+38 and B2224+64 have the highest inferred 2D speeds of ~1600 km s?1. We study the mean speeds for different subsamples and find that, in general, they agree with previous results. Applying a novel deconvolution technique to the sample of 73 pulsars with characteristic ages less than 3 Myr, we find the mean three-dimensional (3D) pulsar birth velocity to be 400(40) km s?1. The distribution of velocities is well described by a Maxwellian distribution with 1D rms ? = 265 km s?1. There is no evidence for a bimodal velocity distribution. The proper motions for PSRs B1830-08 and B2334+61 are consistent with their proposed associations with the supernova remnants W41 and G114.3+0.3, respectively.},

From a comparison of our results with Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the mean birth speed of a pulsar is ~250�300 km s?1, rather than the 450 km s?1 found by Lyne & Lorimer. The resultant distribution is consistent with a Maxwellian with dispersion ?? = 190 km s?1. Despite the large birth velocities, we find that the pulsars with long characteristic ages show the asymmetric drift, indicating that they are dynamically old. These pulsars may result from the low-velocity tail of the younger population, although modified by their origin in binaries and by evolution in the galactic potential.},

Stellar luminosity, radius and core mass are given as a function of age, M and Z, for all phases from the zero-age main sequence up to, and including, the remnant stages. For the most part we find continuous formulae accurate to within 5 per cent of detailed models. These formulae are useful for purposes such as population synthesis that require very rapid but accurate evaluation of stellar properties, and in particular for use in combination with N-body codes. We describe a mass-loss prescription that can be used with these formulae, and investigate the resulting stellar remnant distribution.},

  abstract={We derive the theoretical distribution function of black hole masses by studying the formation processes of black holes. We use the results of recent two-dimensional simulations of stellar core collapse to obtain the relation between remnant and progenitor masses and fold it with an initial mass function for the progenitors. Thus, we are able to derive the binary black hole mass distribution. We examine how the calculated black hole mass distributions are modified by (1) strong-wind mass loss at different evolutionary stages of the progenitors and (2) the presence of close binary companions to the black hole progenitors. The compact-remnant distribution is dominated by neutron stars in the mass range 1.2-1.6 M ☉ and falls off exponentially at higher remnant masses. Our results are most sensitive to mass loss from stellar winds (particularly from Wolf-Rayet stars), and the effects of winds are even more important in close binaries. Wind mass loss leads to flatter black hole mass distributions and limits the maximum possible black hole mass ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 10-15 M ☉ ). We also study the effects of the uncertainties in the explosion and unbinding energies for different progenitors. The distributions are continuous and extend over a broad range. We find no evidence for a gap at low values (3-5 M ☉ ) or for a peak at higher values (~7 M ☉ ) of black hole masses, but we argue that our black hole mass distribution for binaries is consistent with the current sample of measured black hole masses in X-ray transients. We discuss possible biases against the detection or formation of X-ray transients with low-mass black holes. We also comment on the possibility of black hole kicks and their effect on binaries.}

  abstract={Advanced gravitational wave interferometers, currently under realization, will soon permit the detection of gravitational waves from astronomical sources. To open the era of precision gravitational wave astronomy, a further substantial improvement in sensitivity is required. The future space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and the third-generation ground-based observatory Einstein Telescope (ET) promise to achieve the required sensitivity improvements in frequency ranges. The vastly improved sensitivity of the third generation of gravitational wave observatories could permit detailed measurements of the sources' physical parameters and could complement, in a multi-messenger approach, the observation of signals emitted by cosmological sources obtained through other kinds of telescopes. This paper describes the progress of the ET project which is currently in its design study phase.}

  abstract={We present the results of a search for gravitational waves associated with 154 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that were detected by satellite-based gamma-ray experiments in 2009-2010, during the sixth LIGO science run and the second and third Virgo science runs. We perform two distinct searches: a modeled search for coalescences of either two neutron stars or a neutron star and black hole, and a search for generic, unmodeled gravitational-wave bursts. We find no evidence for gravitational-wave counterparts, either with any individual GRB in this sample or with the population as a whole. For all GRBs we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor, under the optimistic assumption of a gravitational-wave emission energy of 10 –2 M ☉ c 2 at 150 Hz, with a median limit of 17 Mpc. For short-hard GRBs we place exclusion distances on binary neutron star and neutron-star-black-hole progenitors, using astrophysically motivated priors on the source parameters, with median values of 16 Mpc and 28 Mpc, respectively. These distance limits, while significantly larger than for a search that is not aided by GRB satellite observations, are not large enough to expect a coincidence with a GRB. However, projecting these exclusions to the sensitivities of Advanced LIGO and Virgo, which should begin operation in 2015, we find that the detection of gravitational waves associated with GRBs will become quite possible.}

  abstract={The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are second-generation instruments designed and built for the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, USA. The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry–Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid and high frequencies. Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in mid-2015.}

  abstract={The coalescence of compact binaries containing neutron stars or black holes is one of the most promising signals for advanced ground-based laser interferometer gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, with the first direct detections expected over the next few years. The rate of binary coalescences and the distribution of component masses is highly uncertain, and population synthesis models predict a wide range of plausible values. Poorly constrained parameters in population synthesis models correspond to poorly understood astrophysics at various stages in the evolution of massive binary stars, the progenitors of binary neutron star and binary black hole systems. These include effects such as supernova kick velocities, parameters governing the energetics of common envelope evolution and the strength of stellar winds. Observing multiple binary black hole systems through GWs will allow us to infer details of the astrophysical mechanisms that lead to their formation. Here we simulate GW observations from a series of population synthesis models including the effects of known selection biases, measurement errors and cosmology. We compare the predictions arising from different models and show that we will be able to distinguish between them with observations (or the lack of them) from the early runs of the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. This will allow us to narrow down the large parameter space for binary evolution models.}

  abstract={An up-to-date catalog of nearby galaxies considered to be hosts of binary compact objects is provided, with complete information about sky position, distance, extinction-corrected blue luminosity, and error estimates. With our current understanding of binary evolution, rates of formation and coalescence for binary compact objects scale with massive-star formation, and hence the (extinction-corrected) blue luminosity of host galaxies. Coalescence events in binary compact objects are among the most promising gravitational-wave sources for ground-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO. Our catalog and associated error estimates are important for the interpretation of analyses carried out for LIGO, in constraining the rates of compact binary coalescence, given an astrophysical population model for the sources considered. We discuss how the notion of effective distance, created to account for the antenna pattern of a gravitational-wave detector, must be used in conjunction with our catalog. We also note that the catalog provided can be used in other astronomical analysis of populations that scale with galaxy blue luminosity.}

abstract ={Using Monte Carlo calculations of the modern scenario for binary stellar evolution, and taking account of the spin evolution of magnetized compact stars (the �scenario machine�), we compute for the first time the number of galactic binary pulsars with different companion types [OB star, white dwarf (WD), neutron star (NS), black hole (BH), or planet] assuming various phenomenological distributions for kick velocities of newborn NSs. We demonstrate a strong dependence of the binary pulsar population fractions relative to single pulsars on the mean kick velocity, and find an optimal kick velocity of 150�200 km s?1.We also investigate the way in which the merging rates of relativistic binary stars (NS + NS, NS + BH, BH + BH) depend on the kick velocity. We show that the BH + BH merging may occur, depending on the parameters of BH formation, at a rate of one per 200000�500000 yr in a Milky Way-type galaxy. The NS + NS merging rate Rns is found to be 1 per ? 3000 yr for zero recoil, and decreases to one per 10 000 yr even for the highest kick velocities of 400 km s?1. That the merging rates derived from evolutionary calculations are higher, by two orders of magnitude, than those based on binary pulsar statistics only, is suggested to be the result of the fact that the observable binary pulsars in pairs with NSs form only a fraction of the total number of binary NS systems.The merging rates obtained imply an expected detection rate of binary BHs (by a gravitational wave detector) comparable with and even higher than the binary NS merging rate for a wide range of parameters. Detecting the final frequency of a merging event at about 100 Hz and the shaping of the waveforms would bring firm evidence of the existence of BHs in nature.},

  abstract={An electron-capture supernova (ECSN) is a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion of a super-asymptotic giant branch (SAGB) star with a main-sequence mass M MS ~ 7-9.5 M ☉ . The explosion takes place in accordance with core bounce and subsequent neutrino heating and is a unique example successfully produced by first-principle simulations. This allows us to derive a first self-consistent multicolor light curve of a CCSN. Adopting the explosion properties derived by the first-principle simulation, i.e., the low explosion energy of 1.5 × 10 50 erg and the small 56 Ni mass of 2.5 × 10 –3 M ☉ , we perform a multi-group radiation hydrodynamics calculation of ECSNe and present multicolor light curves of ECSNe of SAGB stars with various envelope masses and hydrogen abundances. We demonstrate that a shock breakout has a peak luminosity of L ~ 2 × 10 44 erg s –1 and can evaporate circumstellar dust up to R ~ 10 17 cm for the case of carbon dust, that the plateau luminosity and plateau duration of ECSNe are L ~ 10 42 erg s –1 and t ~ 60-100 days, respectively, and that a plateau is followed by a tail with a luminosity drop by ~4 mag. The ECSN shows a bright and short plateau that is as bright as typical Type II plateau supernovae, and a faint tail that might be influenced by the spin-down luminosity of a newborn pulsar. Furthermore, the theoretical models are compared with ECSN candidates: SN 1054 and SN 2008S. We find that SN 1054 shares the characteristics of the ECSNe. For SN 2008S, we find that its faint plateau requires an ECSN model with a significantly low explosion energy of E ~ 10 48 erg.}

  abstract={The mass distribution of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes provides vital clues into the nature of stellar core collapse and the physical engine responsible for supernova explosions. A number of supernova engines have been proposed: neutrino- or oscillation-driven explosions enhanced by early (developing in 10-50?ms) and late-time (developing in 200?ms) convection as well as magnetic field engines (in black hole accretion disks or neutron stars). Using our current understanding of supernova engines, we derive mass distributions of stellar compact remnants. We provide analytic prescriptions for both single-star models (as a function of initial star mass) and for binary-star models?prescriptions for compact object masses for major population synthesis codes. These prescriptions have implications for a range of observations: X-ray binary populations, supernova explosion energies, and gravitational wave sources. We show that advanced gravitational radiation detectors (like LIGO/VIRGO or the Einstein Telescope) will be able to further test the supernova explosion engine models once double black hole inspirals are detected.}

  abstract={The last decade of observational and theoretical developments in stellar and binary evolution provides an opportunity to incorporate major improvements to the predictions from population synthesis models. We compute the Galactic merger rates for NS-NS, BH-NS, and BH-BH mergers with the StarTrack code. The most important revisions include updated wind mass-loss rates (allowing for stellar-mass black holes up to 80 M ☉ ), a realistic treatment of the common envelope phase (a process that can affect merger rates by 2-3 orders of magnitude), and a qualitatively new neutron star/black hole mass distribution (consistent with the observed "mass gap"). Our findings include the following. (1) The binding energy of the envelope plays a pivotal role in determining whether a binary merges within a Hubble time. (2) Our description of natal kicks from supernovae plays an important role, especially for the formation of BH-BH systems. (3) The masses of BH-BH systems can be substantially increased in the case of low metallicities or weak winds. (4) Certain combinations of parameters underpredict the Galactic NS-NS merger rate and can be ruled out. (5) Models incorporating delayed supernovae do not agree with the observed NS/BH "mass gap," in accordance with our previous work. This is the first in a series of three papers. The second paper will study the merger rates of double compact objects as a function of redshift, star formation rate, and metallicity. In the third paper, we will present the detection rates for gravitational-wave observatories, using up-to-date signal waveforms and sensitivity curves.}

In this paper, we select from an extremely broad family of possible population synthesis models those few (2%) that are consistent with the rate implications of the observed sample of NS-NS binaries. To further sharpen the constraints the observed NS-NS population places on our understanding of compact object formation processes, we separate the observed NS-NS population into two channels: (1) merging NS-NS binaries, which will inspiral and merge through the action of gravitational waves within 10 Gyr and (2) wide NS-NS binaries, consisting of all the rest. With the subset of astrophysically consistent models, we explore the implications for the rates at which double black hole (BH-BH), black hole-neutron star (BH-NS), and NS-NS binaries merge through the emission of gravitational waves.}

abstract ={We have performed a detailed population synthesis on a large number (2 � 107) of binary systems in order to investigate the properties of massive double degenerate binaries. We have included new important results in our input physics in order to obtain more reliable estimates of the merging time-scales and relative formation rates. These improvements include refined treatment of the binding energy in a common envelope, helium star evolution and reduced kicks imparted to new-born black holes. The discovery and observations of gamma-ray burst afterglows and the identification of host galaxies have allowed comparisons of theoretical distributions of merger sites with the observed distribution of afterglow positions relative to host galaxies. To help investigate the physical nature of short- and long-duration gamma-ray bursts, we compute the distances of merging neutron stars (NS) and/or black holes (BH) from the centres of their host galaxies, as predicted by their formation scenario combined with motion in galactic potentials. Furthermore, we estimate the formation rate and merging rate of these massive double degenerate binaries. The latter is very important for the prospects of detecting gravitational waves with LIGO/VIRGO. We find that the expected detection rate for LIGO II is ?850 yr?1 for galactic field sources and that this rate is completely dominated by merging double black hole (BHBH) binaries. Even LIGO I may detect such an event (?0.25 yr?1). Our preferred model estimates the Galactic field double neutron star (NSNS) merger rate to be ?1.5 � 10?6 yr?1. For BHBH systems this model predicts a merger rate of ?9.7 � 10?6 yr?1. Our studies also reveal an accumulating numerous population of very wide-orbit BHBH systems which never merge (???Hubble).},

Utilizing the high angular resolution and depth of HST we characterize the host galaxy morphologies, measure precise projected physical and host-normalized offsets between the bursts and host centers, and calculate the locations of the bursts with respect to their host light distributions (rest-frame UV and optical). We calculate a median short GRB projected physical offset of 4.5 kpc, about 3.5 times larger than that for long GRBs, and find that ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 25% of short GRBs have offsets of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 10 kpc. When compared to their host sizes, the median offset is 1.5 half-light radii ( r e ), about 1.5 times larger than the values for long GRBs, core-collapse supernovae, and Type Ia supernovae. In addition, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 20% of short GRBs having offsets of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 5 r e , and only ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 25% are located within 1 r e . We further find that short GRBs severely under-represent their hosts' rest-frame optical and UV light, with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 30%-45% of the bursts located in regions of their host galaxies that have no detectable stellar light, and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 55% in the regions with no UV light. Therefore, short GRBs do not occur in regions of star formation or even stellar mass. This demonstrates that the progenitor systems of short GRBs must migrate from their birth sites to their eventual explosion sites, a signature of kicks in compact object binary systems. Utilizing the full sample of offsets, we estimate natal kick velocities of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 20-140 km s –1 . These independent lines of evidence provide the strongest support to date that short GRBs result from the merger of compact object binaries (NS-NS/NS-BH).}

They are prodigious emitters of neutrinos and quite likely strong galactic sources of gravitational waves. Observation of both neutrinos and gravitational waves from the next galactic or near extragalactic core-collapse supernova will yield a wealth of information on the explosion mechanism, but also on the structure and angular momentum of the progenitor star, and on aspects of fundamental physics such as the equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities and low entropies. In this contribution to the proceedings of the Neutrino 2012 conference, we summarize recent progress made in the theoretical understanding and modeling of core-collapse supernovae. In this, our emphasis is on multi-dimensional processes involved in the explosion mechanism such as neutrino-driven convection and the standing accretion shock instability. As an example of how supernova neutrinos can be used to probe fundamental physics, we discuss how the rise time of the electron antineutrino flux observed in detectors can be used to probe the neutrino mass hierarchy. Finally, we lay out aspects of the neutrino and gravitational-wave signature of core-collapse supernovae and discuss the power of combined analysis of neutrino and gravitational wave data from the next galactic core-collapse supernova.

  abstract={By reaching through shrouding blastwaves, efficiently discovering off-axis events and probing the central engine at work, gravitational wave (GW) observations will soon revolutionize the study of gamma-ray bursts. Already, analyses of GW data targeting gamma-ray bursts have helped constrain the central engines of selected events. Advanced GW detectors with significantly improved sensitivities are under construction. After outlining the GW emission mechanisms from gamma-ray burst progenitors (binary coalescences, stellar core collapses, magnetars and others) that may be detectable with advanced detectors, we review how GWs will improve our understanding of gamma-ray burst central engines, their astrophysical formation channels and the prospects and methods for different search strategies. We place special emphasis on multimessenger searches. To achieve the most scientific benefit, GW, electromagnetic and neutrino observations should be combined to provide greater discriminating power and science reach.}

abstract ={The most promising astrophysical sources of kHz gravitational waves (GWs) are the inspiral and merger of binary neutron star(NS)/black hole systems. Maximizing the scientific return of a GW detection will require identifying a coincident electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. One of the most likely sources of isotropic EM emission from compact object mergers is a supernova-like transient powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in ejecta from the merger. We present the first calculations of the optical transients from compact object mergers that self-consistently determine the radioactive heating by means of a nuclear reaction network; using this heating rate, we model the light curve with a one-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer calculation. For an ejecta mass ?10?2 M? (10?3 M?) the resulting light-curve peaks on a time-scale ?1 d at a V-band luminosity ?L?? 3 � 1041 (1041) erg s?1[MV=?15(?14)]; this corresponds to an effective �f� parameter ?3 � 10?6 in the Li�Paczynski toy model. We argue that these results are relatively insensitive to uncertainties in the relevant nuclear physics and to the precise early-time dynamics and ejecta composition. Since NS merger transients peak at a luminosity that is a factor of ?103 higher than a typical nova, we propose naming these events �kilo-novae�. Because of the rapid evolution and low luminosity of NS merger transients, EM counterpart searches triggered by GW detections will require close collaboration between the GW and astronomical communities. NS merger transients may also be detectable following a short-duration gamma-ray burst or �blindly� with present or upcoming optical transient surveys. Because the emission produced by NS merger ejecta is powered by the formation of rare r-process elements, current optical transient surveys can directly constrain the unknown origin of the heaviest elements in the Universe.},

  abstract={The central engine of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) is hidden from direct view, operating at a scale much smaller than that probed by the emitted radiation. Thus we must infer its origin not only with respect to the formation of the trigger —the actual astrophysical configuration that is capable of powering an sGRB—but also from the consequences that follow from the various evolutionary pathways that may be involved in producing it. Considering binary neutron star mergers we critically evaluate, analytically and through numerical simulations, whether the neutrino-driven wind produced by the newly formed hyper-massive neutron star can allow the collimated relativistic outflow that follows its collapse to actually produce an sGRB or not. Upon comparison with the observed sGRB duration distribution, we find that collapse cannot be significantly delayed (≤100 ms) before the outflow is choked, thus limiting the possibility that long-lived hyper-massive remnants can account for these events. In the case of successful breakthrough of the jet through the neutrino-driven wind, the energy stored in the cocoon could contribute to the precursor and extended emission observed in sGRBs.}

The evolution of 23328 particles based on the orbits of 32 well-known Centaurs is followed for up to 3 Myr in the forward and backward direction under the influence of the four massive planets. The objects exhibit a rich variety of dynamical behaviour with half-lives ranging from 540 kyr (1996AR20) to 32 Myr (2000FZ53). The mean half-life of the entire sample of Centaurs is 2.7 Myr. The data are analysed using a classification scheme based on the controlling planets at perihelion and aphelion, previously given in Horner et al. Transfer probabilities are computed and show the main dynamical pathways of the Centaur population. The total number of Centaurs with diameters larger than 1 km is estimated as ?44300, assuming an inward flux of one new short-period comet every 200 yr. The flux into the Centaur region from the Edgeworth�Kuiper Belt is estimated to be one new object every 125 yr. Finally, the flux from the Centaur region to Earth-crossing orbits is one new Earth-crosser every 880 yr.},

abstract ={Cassini has identified a geologically active province at the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus. In images acquired by the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), this region is circumscribed by a chain of folded ridges and troughs at ?55�S latitude. The terrain southward of this boundary is distinguished by its albedo and color contrasts, elevated temperatures, extreme geologic youth, and narrow tectonic rifts that exhibit coarse-grained ice and coincide with the hottest temperatures measured in the region. Jets of fine icy particles that supply Saturn's E ring emanate from this province, carried aloft by water vapor probably venting from subsurface reservoirs of liquid water. The shape of Enceladus suggests a possible intense heating epoch in the past by capture into a 1:4 secondary spin/orbit resonance.},

  abstract={We present observations of the afterglows and host galaxies of three short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs): 100625A, 101219A, and 110112A. We find that GRB 100625A occurred in a z = 0.452 early-type galaxy with a stellar mass of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 4.6 × 10 9 M ☉ and a stellar population age of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 0.7 Gyr, and GRB 101219A originated in a star-forming galaxy at z = 0.718 with a stellar mass of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 1.4 × 10 9 M ☉ , a star formation rate of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 16 M ☉ yr –1 , and a stellar population age of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 50 Myr. We also report the discovery of the optical afterglow of GRB 110112A, which lacks a coincident host galaxy to i ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 26 mag, and we cannot conclusively identify any field galaxy as a possible host. From afterglow modeling, the bursts have inferred circumburst densities of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 10 –4 -1 cm –3 and isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray and kinetic energies of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 10 50 -10 51 erg. These three events highlight the diversity of galactic environments that host short GRBs. To quantify this diversity, we use the sample of 36 Swift short GRBs with robust associations to an environment (~1/2 of 68 short bursts detected by Swift to 2012 May) and classify bursts originating from four types of environments: late-type ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 50%), early-type ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 15%), inconclusive ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 20%), and "host-less" (lacking a coincident host galaxy to limits of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 26 mag; ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 15%). To find likely ranges for the true late- and early-type fractions, we assign each of the host-less bursts to either the late- or early-type category using probabilistic arguments and consider the scenario that all hosts in the inconclusive category are early-type galaxies to set an upper bound on the early-type fraction. We calculate most likely ranges for the late- and early-type fractions of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 60%-80% and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 20%-40%, respectively. We find no clear trend between gamma-ray duration and host type. We also find no change to the fractions when excluding events recently claimed as possible contaminants from the long GRB/collapsar population. Our reported demographics are consistent with a short GRB rate driven by both stellar mass and star formation.}

abstract ={The double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039A/B is unique in that both neutron stars are detectable as radio pulsars. They are also known to have much higher mean orbital velocities and accelerations than those of other binary pulsars. The system is therefore a good candidate for testing Einstein's theory of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime. We report on precision timing observations taken over the 2.5 years since its discovery and present four independent strong-field tests of general relativity. These tests use the theory-independent mass ratio of the two stars. By measuring relativistic corrections to the Keplerian description of the orbital motion, we find that the �post-Keplerian� parameter s agrees with the value predicted by general relativity within an uncertainty of 0.05%, the most precise test yet obtained. We also show that the transverse velocity of the system's center of mass is extremely small. Combined with the system's location near the Sun, this result suggests that future tests of gravitational theories with the double pulsar will supersede the best current solar system tests. It also implies that the second-born pulsar may not have formed through the core collapse of a helium star, as is usually assumed.},

  abstract={We present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types of compact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial and advanced versions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo. Astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a number of assumptions and unknown model parameters and are still uncertain. The most confident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary neutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in our galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 Myr −1 per Milky Way Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 Myr −1 MWEG −1 to 1000 Myr −1 MWEG −1 (Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 601 L179; Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 614 L137 (erratum)). We convert coalescence rates into detection rates based on data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and projected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. Using the detector sensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02 per year for Initial LIGO–Virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between 2 × 10 −4 and 0.2 per year. The likely binary neutron–star detection rate for the Advanced LIGO–Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range between 0.4 and 400 per year.}
