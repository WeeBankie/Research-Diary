    \item Downloaded IDL Astro and Cayode Libraries to the \texttt{papc-astlab-31} machine and configured the \texttt{!PATH} in IDL.
    \item Downloaded Radon code scripts from GitHub. Attempted to run the Radon code \texttt{example.pro} but obtained a couple of errors. Sent email on Sunday 12.05.19 to VW seeking help with this.
